Grading Criteria / Marking Rubric Your submission will be graded according to the following criteria:

  Identification   of   Knowledge   Gap   and   Research   Question
  Reflection   and   Evaluation of   Research   Methods,   including   a   critical   comparison   of   GenAI and traditional   methods.
  Critical   and Thematic   Integration   of   Sources
See the marking rubric at the end of the remit for more information on how your work will be marked and graded. Ethical Use of Generative AI (GenAI) You are required to use GenAI to support your submission for this assessment. You may use it for the following activities: • Researching and refining your ideas • Information retrieval or background research • Drafting an outline to organise or summarise your thoughts • Refining research questions • Checking spelling and grammar Applying GenAI tools should be done with human oversight and control. You should carefully review and use the results carefully as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete, uncritical, or biased. You may not submit any work generated by an AI tool as your own. Where you include any material generated by an AI tool, it should be properly declared just like any other reference material. Alongside your assignment you should also provide a commentary in the Cover Sheet detailing how GenAI has been used to develop your final submission. If you have not used GenAI tools, you should clearly state so. Plagiarism, including that which results from using GenAI, is a form. of academic misconduct that will be dealt with under the University’s Code of Practice on Academic Integrity. https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/registry/policy/conduct/plagiarism/index.aspx University guidance on ethical use of GenAI can be found here: https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/asc/student-guidance-gai.aspx Further Guidance: Feedback to Students: Both Summative and Formative feedback is given to encourage students to reflect on their learning that feed forward into following assessment tasks. The preparation for all assessment tasks will be supported by formative feedback within the tutorials/seminars. Written feedback is provided as appropriate. Please be aware to use a web browser and not the Canvas App as you may not be able to view all comments. Plagiarism: It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand correct referencing practices. You are expected to use appropriate references and keep carefully detailed notes of all your i代 写33969 PASDE A 代做程序编程语言nformation sources, including any material downloaded from the Internet. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are not vulnerable to any alleged breaches of the assessment regulations. More information is available at University’s Code of Practice on Academic Integrity https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/registry/policy/conduct/plagiarism/index.aspx . Wellbeing, Extensions and Extenuating Circumstances: The processes for extensions and extenuating circumstances (ECs) are to support students who have experienced unforeseen issues that have impacted their ability to engage with their studies and/or complete assessments. Students should notify Wellbeing of any extenuating circumstances as soon as possible via the online form, following the guidance provided. https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/social-sciences/college-services/wellbeing/index.aspx Writing a literature review in 2024. Part 1: Literature Review Using CopilotFor the first part, select one of the provided topics and utilise Copilot as your primary research tool and assistant. Narrow down your chosen topic with the assistance of Copilot and compose a literature review. Your review should identify a gap in the existing body of knowledge and conclude with a clear research question. Ensure that you integrate sources thematically and critically rather than merely summarising them. Provide areference list for this Part with at least 5 references. Part 2: Literature Review Using Specialist Tools and Google ScholarIn the second part, build upon the literature review from Part 1. Write additional 500 words (maximum) literature review on the same topic. Employ specialist literature review tools and Google Scholar to gather additional information, refining and narrowing down your topic further. You are expected to read at least the introduction and conclusion of five original articles. Your literature review should once again identify a gap in the existing knowledge and conclude with a refined research question. Remember to adopt a critical and analytical approach. Provide areference list for this Part with at least 7 references. Part 3: ReflectionThis part of the assessment requires you to reflect on your work in Parts 1 and 2. Firstly, compare and critically evaluate both parts (Part 1 and Part 2) according to the following criteria:

        Relevance   and   appropriateness of   integration   of   sources;
        Identification of   research   gaps   and   appropriate   formulation   of the   research   question;
        Literature   review   provides   a   critical and   in-depth   analysis,   with   some   originality.
Secondly, taking into account your evaluation of Part 1 and Part 2, provide a reflection on the process of writing these two parts. In your reflection, consider the following themes (i) Usefulness of GenAI Tools (e.g. How useful were GenAI tools in researching the original topic? Did they help you narrow down your topic effectively?); (ii) Comparison of Research Methods (e.g. How does reading original articles compare with using summaries from GenAI tools? Which method provided more depth and clarity?); (iii) Accuracy and Clarity of GenAI Tools (e.g. Were GenAI tools incorrect, vague, or providing unsubstantiated statements? Did this lead you to write a weaker literature review?). Note: you do not need to provide any additional references for Part 3, unless you want to give one or two examples of key articles missing from Parts 1 2. List of Topics:

  The Effects of   Fiscal Policy on Economic   Growth
  Microfinance and Economic Development
  The   Economics   of   Entertainment
  Economic   Impact   of   Tourism
  Income Inequality and Economic Mobility
